# INFERNO ENGINE
Inferno Core is an advanced, production-grade Deep Learning web application built to generate statistically probable text sequences in real-time. Powered by a custom Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network built with TensorFlow/Keras, it takes a user's seed sentence and predicts incoming words based on deep contextual memory.
